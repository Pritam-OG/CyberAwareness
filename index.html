                Cyber scams are fraudulent activities conducted through digital platforms to deceive
                individuals
                or
                businesses
                into
                providing sensitive information, financial assets, or personal data. These scams exploit technology,
                psychology, and
                social engineering to manipulate victims. Common types of cyber scams include phishing, ransomware
                attacks,
                identity
                theft, online shopping fraud, and social media scams.
